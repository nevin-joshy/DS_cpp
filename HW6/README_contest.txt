HOMEWORK 6 CONTEST: INVERSE WORD SEARCH


NAME:  Nevin Joshy


OPTIMIZATIONS:
What did you do?
I treid my best to make sure my code only looped through the grid when it had to


TEST CASE SUMMARY:
How did your program perform on the different test cases?  Summarize
the running times.  (It's ok if it didn't finish the harder examples.)
What new test cases did you create and how did it perform on those
tests?

The running time was the main problem for me. I t ran well on the smaller test cases
for the most part, but not on the bigger ones that were more expensive.
