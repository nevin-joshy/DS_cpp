NOTES:

The left and right justify seemed pretty strightforward to me and were almost identical to each other in their code. The full jusitfy took me the longest as it was the most complex. One of the things that was the most frustrating was that C++ isnt specific as to where a seg fault happens, so I had to search hard to find where they would occur. Also, when using the insert function, I found that I have to use vector_name.begin()+(whatever number in the vector) for the index, not just the int value. Finally, reading and writing to files took a bit of getting used to but I was able to figure it out!
